# Multi-Agent Team Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan builds upon the original implementation with enhanced safeguards for infinite loop prevention, improved memory management, and a phased approach to development.

## Key Enhancements from Review
- **Multi-layer termination logic** with repetition detection and stalemate identification
- **Progressive timeout strategy** based on conversation complexity
- **Consensus detection with confidence scoring**
- **Agent-specific termination triggers**
- **Conversation state tracking**
- **Automatic memory cleanup** and size management

   - Validation rules and constraints

3. **Requirements & Setup** (`requirements.txt`, `.env.example`)
   - Dependency management
   - Environment configuration

### Phase 4: Testing & Refinement
**Goal**: Validate system performance and user experience

1. **Test Suite** (`tests/`)
   - Unit tests for core components
   - Integration tests for agent interactions
   - Performance tests for memory management

2. **Documentation** (`README.md`, `USAGE.md`)
   - Setup instructions
   - Usage examples
   - Troubleshooting guide

### Phase 5: Optional Enhancements
**Goal**: Advanced features and integrations

**Components**:
1. **API Endpoints** (`api.py`)
   - FastAPI integration
   - RESTful endpoints for queries
   - Webhook support

2. **Advanced Features**
   - SQLite alternative for memory
   - Real-time conversation monitoring
   - Export/import functionality

## Technical Specifications

### Enhanced Termination Logic
```python
# Multi-layer approach:
1. Consensus reached detection
2. Repetition/cycling detection
3. Stalemate identification
4. Round limit enforcement
5. Agent-specific triggers
```

### Memory Management Strategy
```python
# Automatic cleanup:
1. Age-based removal (30 days default)
2. Size-based limits (50MB default)
3. Task-based organization
4. Compression for old conversations
```

### Consensus Detection
```python
# Confidence scoring:
1. Agreement indicators tracking
2. Topic repetition monitoring
3. Agent participation balance
4. Progress assessment
```
