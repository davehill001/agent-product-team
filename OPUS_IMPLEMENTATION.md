# OPUS Framework Implementation for Multi-Agent Team System

## üéØ Overview

This document outlines the implementation of the **OPUS framework** (Outcome, Purpose, User, Scenario) into the existing multi-agent team system. The OPUS framework will transform the current wireframe generation system into a more structured, user-focused, and debate-driven approach that produces high-quality, actionable designs for Cursor code generation.

## üèóÔ∏è Current System Analysis

### Existing Architecture
- **5 Agents**: Product Manager (Max), Designer (Alex), Engineer (Sam), QA (Jamie), Customer Advocate
- **AutoGen Integration**: Group chat with consensus detection
- **Output**: JSON wireframes with schema validation
- **Memory**: Conversation history and state tracking

### Current Limitations
- No structured OPUS framework integration
- Limited debate mechanics
- Missing backend engineering perspective
- No explicit OPUS-based output format

## üéØ OPUS Framework Integration

### What is OPUS?

**OPUS** is a structured framework for design thinking that breaks down features into four key elements:

1. **Outcome**: What users want to achieve
2. **Purpose**: Why the feature exists  
3. **User**: Who the feature is for
4. **Scenario**: When/how the feature is used

### OPUS Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 1: Agent Role Redefinition
Transform existing agents to incorporate OPUS framework:

```python
# Current Agent Roles ‚Üí OPUS-Enhanced Roles
Max (PM) ‚Üí PM with OPUS Outcome/Purpose focus
Alex (Designer) ‚Üí Designer with OPUS User/Scenario focus  
Sam (Engineer) ‚Üí FE Developer with OPUS technical feasibility
NEW: Backend Engineer ‚Üí BE Developer with OPUS data/API focus
Jamie (QA) ‚Üí QA with OPUS testing/edge case focus
Customer Advocate ‚Üí User Advocate with OPUS user value focus
```

#### Phase 2: OPUS Discussion Framework
Implement structured OPUS-based discussions:

```python
# OPUS Discussion Structure
1. Outcome Analysis: What do users want to achieve?
2. Purpose Definition: Why does this feature exist?
3. User Identification: Who is this feature for?
4. Scenario Mapping: When/how is this feature used?
5. OPUS Integration: How do all elements work together?
6. Consensus Building: Agreement on OPUS structure
```

#### Phase 3: OPUS Output Format
Transform wireframe JSON to include OPUS elements:

```json
{
  "app": {
    "name": "App Name",
    "description": "App description",
    "opus_framework": {
      "outcome": "What users want to achieve",
      "purpose": "Why the app exists",
      "user": "Who the app is for",
      "scenario": "When/how the app is used"
    },
    "screens": [
      {
        "screen_id": "screen_name",
        "name": "Screen Name",
        "opus": {
          "outcome": "Screen-specific outcome",
          "purpose": "Screen-specific purpose", 
          "user": "Screen-specific user",
          "scenario": "Screen-specific scenario"
        },
        "components": [...]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## üéØ OPUS Discussion Framework
