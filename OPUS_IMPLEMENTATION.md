# OPUS Framework Implementation for Multi-Agent Team System

## üéØ Overview

This document outlines the implementation of the **OPUS framework** (Outcome, Purpose, User, Scenario) into the existing multi-agent team system. The OPUS framework will transform the current wireframe generation system into a more structured, user-focused, and debate-driven approach that produces high-quality, actionable designs for Cursor code generation.

## üèóÔ∏è Current System Analysis

### Existing Architecture
- **6 Agents**: Product Manager (Max), Designer (Alex), Frontend Engineer (Sam), Backend Engineer (NEW), QA (Jamie), Customer Advocate
- **AutoGen Integration**: Group chat with consensus detection
- **Output**: OPUS-structured wireframes with clear blocks
- **Memory**: Conversation history and state tracking

### Current Limitations
- No structured OPUS framework integration
- Limited debate mechanics
- Missing backend engineering perspective
- Complex JSON output format

## üéØ OPUS Framework Integration

### What is OPUS?

**OPUS** is a structured framework for design thinking that breaks down features into four key elements:

1. **Outcome (O)**: What users want to achieve
2. **Purpose (P)**: Why the feature exists  
3. **User (U)**: Who the feature is for
4. **Scenario (S)**: When/how the feature is used

### OPUS Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 1: Agent Role Redefinition
Transform existing agents to incorporate OPUS framework:

```python
# Current Agent Roles ‚Üí OPUS-Enhanced Roles
Max (PM) ‚Üí PM with OPUS Outcome/Purpose focus
Alex (Designer) ‚Üí Designer with OPUS User/Scenario focus  
Sam (Engineer) ‚Üí FE Developer with OPUS technical feasibility
NEW: BackendEngineer ‚Üí BE Developer with OPUS data/API focus
Jamie (QA) ‚Üí QA with OPUS testing/edge case focus
Customer Advocate ‚Üí User Advocate with OPUS user value focus
```

#### Phase 2: OPUS Discussion Framework
Implement structured OPUS-based discussions:

```python
# OPUS Discussion Structure
1. Outcome Analysis: What do users want to achieve?
2. Purpose Definition: Why does this feature exist?
3. User Identification: Who is this feature for?
4. Scenario Mapping: When/how is this feature used?
5. OPUS Integration: How do all elements work together?
6. Consensus Building: Agreement on OPUS structure
```

#### Phase 3: OPUS Output Format
Transform to simple, readable OPUS blocks for each screen, component, and function:

```
Name: Login/Sign Up Page
O: Users want to securely access their account and start using the app
P: Provide secure authentication and user account access
U: New users creating accounts, existing users logging in
S: User opens app for first time, user returns to app, user switches devices

Name: Google OAuth Button
O: Users want to quickly sign in using their existing Google account
P: Reduce friction in authentication process and increase conversion
U: Users with Google accounts who prefer social login
S: User clicks "Sign in with Google" during registration or login flow

Name: Login Form Inputs
O: Users want to enter their credentials to access their account
P: Collect and validate user authentication credentials
U: Users with email/password accounts
S: User enters email and password to log in

Name: Login Form Submit Button
O: Users want to submit their credentials and access their account
P: Process authentication request and redirect to main app
U: Users with valid credentials ready to log in
S: User clicks submit after entering email and password
```

## üéØ OPUS Discussion Framework

### Structured OPUS Discussions

Implement a structured approach to OPUS-based discussions:

```python
# OPUS Discussion Phases
OPUS_PHASES = {
    "phase_1": {
        "name": "Outcome Analysis",
        "focus": "What do users want to achieve?",
        "agents": ["Max", "CustomerAdvocate"],
        "output": "User outcomes and success metrics"
    },
    "phase_2": {
        "name": "Purpose Definition", 
        "focus": "Why does this feature exist?",
        "agents": ["Max", "BackendEngineer"],

    }
}
```

### OPUS Debate Mechanics

```python
# OPUS Debate Structure
OPUS_DEBATE_RULES = {
    "outcome_debate": {
        "trigger": "When discussing user outcomes",
        "format": "Reference specific OPUS outcome elements",
        "scoring": "Rate proposals on outcome alignment (1-10)"
    },

        "scoring": "Rate proposals on user alignment (1-10)"
    },
    "scenario_debate": {
        "trigger": "When discussing use scenarios",
        "format": "Reference specific OPUS scenario elements",
        "scoring": "Rate proposals on scenario alignment (1-10)"
    }
}
```
